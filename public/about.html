      Hi! My name is Leonardo, for friends Leo. Iâ€™m 23 years old and I have
      always been passionate about technology and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in coding and web developing started when I was still in
      high school, ITIS C. Zuccante in Mestre, a small town near Venice. During that
      time, I learned to program in Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript and I began
      to develop a passion for website design.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019 I began my studies at the University of Padua, taking the computer
      engineering course and graduating in November 2022. Next on the path is a
      master's degree in Cybersecurity, also at the University of Padua. I
      recently began self-studying web developing so that I would be ready for
      the upcoming entry into the working world. I love learning new design
      techniques and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I love watching and doing sports, that ranges from
      basketball to soccer, running and weight lifting. It helps me to free my
      mind and getting ready to give the best in the important aspect of my
      life.
    </p>

      next project, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to
